                        the country and betterment of the nation rather than being confined into academical studies.
                        That is why one should join different clubs, associations or organizations which help to gain
                        variety of skills and to get involved in different social activities. The organizations or associations
                        give us opportunity to do social work and by such activities our hearts fill with patriotism
                        and love for the nation. One can also improve or achieve various personal skills by participating
                        in the organizational activities. Communication skill, organization skill, leadership quality,
                        public speaking, supervising ability, these are some qualities that can be gained by participating
                        in the works of an organization. To keep pace with the modern era, Bangladesh is trying to be
                        a digital country. Dhaka University IT Society (DUITS) is an organization of Dhaka University
                        that has been working for the last 6 years with a view to spreading knowledge of digitalization
                        among the students and to apply digital method in different functions, activities and programs
                        of the campus. It is the aim of DUITS to make the minds of the students more IT friendly and
                        more connected to the ever developing methods of technology. Within only 6 years DUITS Society
